### Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons. <br>
Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.  
We have some datas thats about customer who has want to take credit card.  
  
**Project's Aim:**  
The aim of the project is predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
